### Wifi Analyzer

This is just an initialization of the project...as always, this repo is more of a learning exercise than anything else, sort of my "coding diary", for lack of a better term. ut I happen to pick up a lot of "toys" recently and looking to build some cool things with them...

[Kismet](https://www.kismetwireless.net) is an 802.11 layer2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system. Kismet will work with any wireless card which supports raw monitoring (rfmon) mode, and (with appropriate hardware) can sniff 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, and 802.11n traffic. Kismet also supports plugins which allow sniffing other media such as ADSB (aircraft) traffic, GSM, LTE, and more.
